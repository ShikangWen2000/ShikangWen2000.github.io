I recently graduated from the Department of Architecture at the [School of Design](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/en-us), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), completing my undergraduate studies in June 2023. My research interests are centered on applying Deep Learning in architecture, with a focus on automated generation and optimization in architectural design and the building environment.

Academic experiences
======
During my undergraduate studies, I completed two significant academic projects. My first project involved utilizing a genetic algorithm to select and optimize shading strategies. This work has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Building Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222015388) (<strong>IF: 6.4</strong>). Following this project, my fascination with dynamic daylight control research grew. I am currently exploring the use of deep learning methods to streamline the process of glare detection. The manuscript related to this research has been accepted by [Automation in Construction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105294) (<strong>IF: 10.3</strong>).

Additionally, my undergraduate project focused on predicting building energy consumption at a city-scale level and examining how inter-building effects impact the performance of deep learning models in such predictions. I developed an innovative graph neural network to enhance the accuracy of predicting building energy consumption. Currently, I am preparing a manuscript on this study for submission to a top-tier journal.
