I recently graduated from the Department of Architecture at the [School of Design](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/en-us), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), completing my undergraduate studies in June 2023. My research focuses on the application of deep learning in the fields of architecture and urban planning, specifically emphasizing automated generation and optimization processes within both building and urban environments.

Academic experiences
====================

During my undergraduate studies, I completed two significant academic projects. My first project involved utilizing a genetic algorithm to select and optimize shading strategies. This work has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Building Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222015388) (`<strong>`IF: 6.4`</strong>`). Following this project, my fascination with dynamic daylight control research grew. I am currently exploring the use of deep learning methods to streamline the process of glare detection. The manuscript related to this research has been accepted by [Automation in Construction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105294) (`<strong>`IF: 10.3`</strong>`).

Additionally, my undergraduate project focused on predicting building energy consumption at a city-scale level and examining how inter-building effects impact the performance of deep learning models in such predictions. I developed an innovative graph neural network to enhance the accuracy of predicting building energy consumption. Currently, I am preparing a manuscript on this study for submission to a top-tier journal.
